## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Verification compares the SAME module run on two nodes, byte for byte. Not multiple implementations of the same computation — cross-implementation verification is explicitly out of scope.
- There is no static determinism analysis. Divergence is detected by the comparison, not predicted ahead of it. The admission gate was built and then deleted; do not reintroduce it. The import object is the sandbox — WebAssembly.instantiate refuses any import the host does not supply.
- The verification claim is split (C3, decided): redundant execution on public/shared data and on the aggregation tree; sovereign maps run redundantly within the owner's own node set when two or more are live, and are owner-attested otherwise.
- Relay decision inverted by evidence: own backbone relay primary (AutoTLS + webRTCDirect), public infra opportunistic only. Browsers structurally cannot dial the majority of public libp2p nodes.
- Ordering is load-bearing: sovereignty before placement, tree-reduce before placement, artifact signing at content-addressing time (not at elfconv time), coordinator checkpointing in the churn phase, governor + benchmark instrumentation in the kernel phase.
- Part I (elfconv AOT) sequenced last and run as a parallel track; it must not block the capacity-scaling thesis.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Disclosure gate:** publishing forfeits EPO/China patent rights permanently. No deploy workflow file may exist in the repository at all — absent, not disabled. Deployment is a separately-triggered human action (DEMO-04).
- **Version traps (C5):** js-libp2p is 3.x with an `EventTarget` stream API break; four look-current trap packages must be avoided (`@chainsafe/libp2p-gossipsub@14`, `@libp2p/noise`, `@libp2p/yamux`, `@libp2p/mplex`). Pin exact versions; the constants-regression test lands in Phase 3.
- **Open decisions carried into planning:** aegir vs. vitest for the three-target test discipline (Phase 2); WASM fuel metering has no maintained JS-side tool (Phase 1/2); Safari + WebRTC-Direct is unverified with a WSS-only fallback branch (Phase 4).
