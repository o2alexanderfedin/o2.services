 * DET-07 — the identical suite runs under every target.
 *
 * The kernel has no platform imports, so the same test files run unchanged in
 * Node and in a real browser. Any test that only passes in one of them means a
 * platform assumption leaked into `@o2/core`, which is exactly what this config
 * exists to catch.
 *
 * The provider comes from `@vitest/browser-playwright` as a *function*. The
 * `provider: 'playwright'` string form is vitest 3.x and silently does nothing on
 * 4.x.
