/**
 * The `node` specs that dominate its wall clock, excluded by `test:unit`.
 *
 * Measured, not guessed from filenames. `vitest run --project node
 * --reporter=json` on 2026-07-29 gave a per-file span for every file in the
 * project: median 37 ms, p75 267 ms, p90 1070 ms, total 252.7 s. The nine files
 * below are every file that came in at or above 1 s.
 *
 * The effect was then measured on the script itself rather than predicted from
 * that table: `npm run test:unit` runs 66 files / 946 tests in **6.46 s**, against
 * `npm run test:node` at 75 files / 1080 tests in **210 s**. Roughly 33× faster for
 * 88 % of the files.
 *
 * The criterion is the measured 1 s cut, which is p90 of that distribution. It is
 * a stated judgement, not a discovered boundary: below `lift.node.test.ts` (22×
 * the next file) the curve is smooth, so no threshold falls in a natural gap. 1 s
 * is chosen because tightening it to 500 ms drops four more files to save only a
 * further 2.3 s.
 *
 * Filename was *not* a usable signal, and neither was the obvious mechanical
 * proxy. Grepping for `node:child_process` or `docker` selects a different set:
 * `disclosure-gate` (528 ms), `purity` (219 ms) and `vocabulary` all spawn real
 * processes and are fast, while `transport-bounds` (9.85 s) and `admission`
 * (7.61 s) — the 2nd and 3rd slowest — import neither. The verified mechanisms are
 * four, not one, and the comment on each line says which applies.
