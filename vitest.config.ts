/**
 * The `perf` project exists only when asked for — `npm run test:perf`.
 *
 * Switched here in the config rather than by a CLI flag, because a project declared
 * unconditionally is part of a bare `vitest run` and
 * `packages/bench/src/perf-gate.perf.test.ts` must not be. It stands up three fabrics and
 * runs 303 jobs plus 303 reference passes, its numbers are only meaningful against the
 * committed baseline in `perf-baseline.ts`, and a wall-clock measurement folded into the
 * everything-run would add minutes and a load-dependent failure mode to every change.
 *
 * `*.perf.test.ts` is therefore excluded from `node` and from `browser` as well. Both
 * halves are needed: the exclusions keep the file out of the default projects, and the
 * conditional keeps the project that does run it out of the default run. Either one alone
 * leaves the gate either running everywhere or reachable nowhere.

/**
 * DET-07 — the identical suite runs under every target.
 *
 * The kernel has no platform imports, so the same test files run unchanged in
 * Node and in a real browser. Any test that only passes in one of them means a
 * platform assumption leaked into `@o2/core`, which is exactly what this config
 * exists to catch.
 *
 * The provider comes from `@vitest/browser-playwright` as a *function*. The
 * `provider: 'playwright'` string form is vitest 3.x and silently does nothing on
 * 4.x.
 *
 * Four projects, split by what a test needs rather than by what it covers:
 *
 *   node     everything that runs in a plain Node process
 *   browser  the same portable specs, in real Chromium
 *   e2e      specs that drive Playwright themselves — see below
 *   perf     the perf gate, present only under `O2_PERF=1` — see `PERF_GATE`
